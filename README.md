*A simple CLI tool to find good StackOverflow users.*


## Install

To install the tool, run:

```console
$ npm install -g sofind
```


## Usage

This tool will give you the Stack Overflow profile URLs of all top users, by
tag, for the past 30 days.

For instance, if I answered the most Stack Overflow questions in the last 30
days about 'python', and got the most points awarded to me, then this tool would
show me as the first URL listed.

It's mainly used as a way to look for good developers (*or your own vanity, heh*) =)

Anyhow. Here's how to use it:

```console
$ sofind ios
$ sofind python
```
